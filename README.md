# UdacityProject_CricketCounter
A project during my Android Development Beginner Nanodegree from Udacity, this project wanted us to create a score counter for any sport/game we wanted. I chose cricket. I have implemented buttons to add scores, count balls etc and then a Swap Strike button to shift the Batting team to Bowling and vice versa.
